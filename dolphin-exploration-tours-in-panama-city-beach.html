"text": "The dolphins in Panama City Beach are present all year round, although many of them are migrating. Most often, they are seen between May and October when the waters are warmer. The best days for visibility are clear and sunny, and you will most likely enjoy your tour when the weather is warm and sunny."

These diseases can pose serious threats to dolphins' health and human health. Finally, swimming with dolphins can be considered harassment. You do not want a penalty.</p></div>

<div class="card-body"><p>The dolphins in Panama City Beach are present all year round, although many of them are migrating. Most often, they are seen between May and October when the waters are warmer. The best days for visibility are clear and sunny, and you will most likely enjoy your tour when the weather is warm and sunny.</p>
