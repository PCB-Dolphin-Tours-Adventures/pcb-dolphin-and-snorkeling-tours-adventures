"text": "If you swim confidently, they&#39;ll approach you and want to interact. Do not touch the dolphins. If they&#39;re wild, chances are that they&#39;re not used to being touched. So just swim confidently and quickly instead of floating around. Scuba gear can be used for this. 25 Aug 2016"

It's due to the Choctawhatchee Bay that is just beyond the beach. This acts as a filter, taking the darker sediment in and leaving clear waters atop Destin’s fine quartz.</p><p>We'll take you into the water before the dolphins arrive. So the dolphins will come to us instead of swimming away. Panama City Beach Dolphin Tours & Adventures LLC has 6 passengers, including children. Our snorkel gear can be put on quickly so you don't have to worry about getting in trouble with the dolphins. There are five boats with identical designs for larger groups. The new Large Family Panama City Beach Dolphin Tours & Adventures LLC can accommodate up to 13 guests. Pets are not allowed onboard boats.</p><p>Captain John was wonderful as well as his side kick, Layla. We saw multiple dolphins, jumped in with them, saw turtles, rays and crabs. <b>Excursion</b>  He also took us to a private beach to search for shells and carried our bucket full back for us. It was great to customize for what we wanted to do as we had a 14, 12 and 10 year old. Great time was had by all!!!”</p></div>
